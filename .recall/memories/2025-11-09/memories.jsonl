{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Successfully upgraded Recall MCP server from brute-force O(n) vector search to sqlite-vec\u0027s vec0 extension with O(log n) indexed KNN search. Replaced manual cosine distance computation with native vec0 MATCH queries. Virtual table schema uses vec0(embedding float[384], \u002Bfile_path TEXT, \u002Bline_number INTEGER) format. All 30 tests passing after migration.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T00:54:33.0436319Z"}
{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Added cross-platform support for sqlite-vec extension. Downloaded and configured vec0 binaries for all platforms: vec0.dll (Windows 272KB), vec0.so (Linux 145KB), vec0.dylib (macOS 158KB). All binaries from v0.1.6 release downloaded from GitHub. Updated Recall.csproj to copy all three binaries to output directory. SQLite\u0027s LoadExtension automatically appends correct extension (.dll/.so/.dylib) based on runtime platform, so no code changes needed. All 11 VectorIndexService tests passing. Recall MCP server now works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T00:57:59.6301849Z"}
{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Configured Recall MCP server as a dotnet tool with NuGet packaging. Added PackAsTool=true and ToolCommandName=recall-mcp to Recall.csproj. Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (build-and-publish.yml) that tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, extracts version from git tags (v*), and publishes to NuGet.org. Package includes all cross-platform vec0 binaries (dll/so/dylib), ONNX model, vocab.txt, and README. Users will install via: dotnet tool install -g Recall.MCP. Workflow requires NUGET_API_KEY secret configured in GitHub repository settings.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:07:36.3216647Z"}
{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Implemented \u0060recall-mcp init\u0060 CLI command to set up slash commands and hooks. Created 4 slash command templates (recall, checkpoint, standup, plan-status) and 1 hook template (post-task.sh) embedded as resources. Users run \u0060recall-mcp init\u0060 in their project to create .claude/commands/ and .claude/hooks/ with templates. Supports --commands, --hooks, and --force flags for selective initialization. Program.cs now handles CLI args before starting MCP server, with --help and --version flags. All templates successfully extract and write to .claude/ directory. This completes TODO item #3 for custom slash commands.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:13:50.8443601Z"}
{"type":"decision","source":"agent","content":"Fixed slash command templates after accidentally mixing goldfish project concepts into Recall. Removed plan-status and standup commands. Recall now only ships with two core slash commands that directly map to MCP tools: /checkpoint (wraps store tool) and /recall (wraps recall tool). No workflow assumptions, just clean wrappers for semantic memory storage and retrieval. Updated help text in InitCommand.cs accordingly.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:16:45.8903686Z"}
{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Fixed slash commands and hooks to follow official Claude Code documentation format. Slash commands now include proper YAML frontmatter with description and argument-hint fields, and use $ARGUMENTS variable for parameters. Replaced incorrect post-task.sh shell script with proper settings.json containing hook configurations in JSON format. Hooks now use correct structure with matchers (e.g., \u0022Write|Edit\u0022), type (\u0022prompt\u0022), and prompt text. Created two example hooks: PostToolUse for suggesting checkpoints after edits, and SessionStart for auto-recalling context. Updated InitCommand to create settings.json instead of individual hook files.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:23:12.0727972Z"}
{"type":"decision","source":"agent","content":"Removed incorrect hooks implementation after reading Claude Code docs. Hooks only support type: \u0022command\u0022 for shell scripts, NOT type: \u0022prompt\u0022 for LLM prompts. Since Recall is an MCP server without useful shell command hooks to provide, removed settings.json.example template entirely. Init command now only creates slash commands (recall.md, checkpoint.md) with correct YAML frontmatter format. Help text points users to official hooks-guide documentation for custom hook configuration.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:25:34.7125461Z"}
{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Enhanced /recall slash command to support time-based filtering for context recovery scenarios. Command now accepts time period arguments (15m, 1h, 2d, 1w) to filter memories by recency. Examples: /recall 15m retrieves last 15 minutes, /recall 1h authentication searches last hour for auth-related work. Useful for resuming work after clearing context. Updated argument-hint to show [[time period] [search query]] format. Command instructs Claude to parse time format and filter recall tool results accordingly.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:29:16.5858277Z"}
{"type":"feature","source":"agent","content":"Implemented multi-workspace architecture for Recall MCP server, enabling cross-project memory queries. Key changes: moved vector index from .recall/index.db to ~/.recall/index.db (user-global), added workspace_path column to schema, updated MemoryEvent model to track workspace origin. Created three MCP tools: store (auto-detects workspace), recall (with workspace filter: current/all/specific), and cleanup (removes orphaned workspaces). Architecture enables workspace-local JSONL files (git-committable) with global vector index for cross-project intelligence. All 23 core tests passing. Committed and tagged as v0.2.0, GitHub Actions workflow building release now. This foundation enables standup reports across projects and cross-codebase pattern discovery.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T14:45:47.2912391Z"}
